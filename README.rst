Introduction
============

Note

Until some proper documentation is written for the new graphing interface, take a look at this youtube video to satiate your curiousity:

This package provides a GUI for managing custom workflows in Plone.

This is the successor of uwosh.northstar's workflow design tool (North* continues on as a file system product generator, given either a PloneFormGen or Dexterity prototype).

Features
--------

 * add/edit/delete new workflows
 * add content rule actions easily for a workflow transition
 * graphical representation workflows
 * easily manipulate workflow permissions

Graphing
--------

In the 2.0 Beta release, the old Graphviz graphing system has been removed, since
the new UI already presents the workflow in the form of an interactive graph.


Plone 3 Support
---------------

You must also have simplejson installed.
